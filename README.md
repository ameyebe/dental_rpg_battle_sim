# dental_rpg_battle_sim
This program was created in python, to promote good dental hygiene.
In this code the user will enter a series of inputs to perform different actions to defeat a enemy.
It was made for a internal in 2019.
No cheat codes included, sorry.
Enter 'H' or 'h' on each of the characters turn to get help on different aspects about the game, like the turn order, goal, what HP, MP and STR are, ETC.
Try to defeat as many enemies as you can.
You can either play by yourself, and give the commands to each individual character on their turn, or have 2 others play with you, which all 3 of you choosing what to do on each characters turn.
After winning a fight you can either enter 'Y', or 'N'.
Entering 'Y' will have you fight another randomly selected enemy, with all you characters current HP, MP, STR and item amounts carried over.
Entering 'N' will end the code and give you a grade from f to s based on how many fights you won.
If all 3 characters HP hit 0, the game will end and you'll get the grade based on how many fights you won.
Doesn't matter whether the inputs you enter are in capital or normal, they'll still work.
Please enjoy my code, don't get offended if the grade you end up with after a battle is offensive, and get to cleaning those teeth.
